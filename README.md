# Images Under Cursor

Chrome extension to find all images and background images laying under the
cursor, whatever their depth or nesting in the DOM tree. This extension also
supports extracting the current frame of
[canvas elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element).

This is useful to circumvent the HTML, Javascript and CSS tricks some websites
use to prevent the user from accessing the page assets â€” which is plain
ridiculous, as there are accessible anyway.
